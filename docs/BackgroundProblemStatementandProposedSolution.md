# BACKGROUND, PROBLEM STATEMENT AND PROPOSED SOLUTION

## <u> <b> INTRODUCTION </b> </u>

South Africa is a multicultural, multicoloured and multilingual nation. The progression of technology has brought about new problems and there is still a long way for people to embrace new technologies and use them to their benefit. South African Minister of  International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor, once said, "In the current state of our economy, which is desperately seeking growth, we need to move away from these so-called older economic models and embrace the new wave or revolution of the information economy. To become a meaningful player in this environment, we will need extensive investment on the part of both the public and private sectors in the development of ICT technology and innovation."[1].

The slow development has given rise to unemployment and a shrinking economy. The technological advancements can be capitalized to counteract these negatives especially between investors and innovators in South Africa.

### <u> <b> COMPANY / INDUSTRY BACKGROUND </b> </u>

The idea is inspired by the American Broadcasting Channel TV series Shark Tank TV also known as Dragons Den in other parts of the world, where emerging entrepreneurs get a few minutes to pitch an idea in the front of five multimillionaire potential investors. The entrepreneurs are asked questions after each pitch and the winner gets the investment[9]. The show acts as a platform to give the emerging entrepreneurs a chance to further their businesses and get a chance to meet investors who they might have never met if it were not for this platform. The ever dwindling economy of South Africa ,the high  unemployment rate and lack of easy flowing funds has resulted in a gap between the investors and the innovators widening. Good ideas are worth listening to and some of them are worth implementing. The 4th Industrial Revolution has brought about tools that can help communication between two people easier, smoother and quicker. The 4th Industrial Revolution being a term that was popularised by the World Economic Forum for current and developing environment in which disruptive technologies and trends are changing the way we live, think, work and relate to one another.[2]   The broadness of the internet and the resources available, if used well, can make a difference towards the economy of South Africa and especially improve the Investment domain.

 
 ### <u> <b> CURRENT SYSTEMS AND/OR PROCEDURES FOLLOWED </b>  </u>


### 1. <u> <b> AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK (MTurk) </b> </u>

What is MTurk & How it works 

Amazon Mechanical Turk is more of a crowdsourcing market place where people can outsource their services and jobs to a large community of workforce who are able to do the job virtually. This kind of system accelerates machine learning which is more of a 4th Industrial Revolution approach that has to be integrated in South Africa. The platform effectively handles management of labor and overhead costs associated with hiring and managing a temporary workforce and it is solely a pay-per-task model. Users can create a worker account where they can make money by completing tasks or create accounts as Requesters that provide tasks or services. The tasks that are outsourced to the vast network of humans are referred to as Human Intelligent Tasks. 
Amazon MTurk provides services for service requesters (referred to as Requesters). Requesters can use the MTurk web user interface or web services API to submit tasks to the MTurk web site, approve completed tasks, and incorporate the answers into their applications. Requesters have the opportunity to approve completed Human intelligent tasks (HITs) before having to pay for them. Requesters can specify that people who work on their tasks must first complete a qualification test, thus giving Requesters the opportunity to vet the skill level of the people working on their HITs beforehand[7].

<u> <b> Advantages of the system </b> </u>

* Ensures that work gets done quickly, while freeing up time and resources for the company, so internal staff can focus on higher value activities [3]. 
Which is beneficial to Requesters from companies.
* You are guaranteed of professional work as most MTurk workers are highly skilled in some areas and will definitely do work of high standard.
* The data collected is generally diversified and has not be found to differ greatly from that collected using other means.
The jobs performed by the virtual workers is on average of great quality acceptable to outsourcing companies and are reliable and consistent.

<u> <b> Disadvantages of the system </b> </u>

* The system does not accommodate everyone as it requires certain minimum qualifications for you to perform tasks and some people are generally eliminated before they even apply. 
* The availability of the system is questionable as it is not globally available. It is available over 190 countries but however, the majority (more than 75%) of MTurk workers live in the United States and India (Paolacci & Chandler, 2014)[4].
* Research shows that there exist fundamental differences among users of MTurk from the general population. 
MTurk workers are more educated, less religious, and more likely to be unemployed than the general population (Goodman, Cryder, & Cheema, 2013). If a researcher is trying to investigate specific trends within minority populations, such as levels of religiosity, or educational differences, these cultural differences could confound future results and limit generalizability.
* Certain sample group of the population is not able to utilize the technology i.e. Older adults and the availability of the technology to accommodate such activities e.g. (a computer, an iPad, a laptop) meaning those of lower socioeconomic statuses might not have access to technology to use MTurk. 

<u> <b> Potential Improvement </b> </u>
 
 * Make the system more available(non-restricted) as it mainly caters for USA .
 * Give  access to people Worldwide.
 * The system should implement checks into the demographics of the person performing a task by collecting responses.

 
### 2. <u> <b> INVESTMENT NETWORK (ANGEL INVESTMENT) </b> </u>

 What is Angel Investment & How it works 

* An innovator registers with the system by only entering their names and email address, the same process applies for the investor. After which the innovator can connect with over 232537 registered investors and get funded. 
* After done registering the innovator now can create his/her pitch on the platform. The pitch is created with an assistance of the template, should a user get stuck they are some on-screen instructions that will assist to get through the steps. 
* Once done adding a pitch the moderator will approve that pitch if it meets the Angel Investment requirements, which will then be listed on the site for prospective investors to browse and evaluate. Once the pitch is on the site the innovator can now email the pitch to the desired investor[5]. 
* If an investor likes the innovator's pitch, he/she can send an email asking to connect. After accepting the innovator gain access to the investors contact details, which allows them to continue discussions, scheduling calls, fix meetings and close investment. 
* Once everything is finalized the investor can transfer the funds directly to the innovator so that there are no commission fees from the site.

 <u> <b> Disadvantages of the system </b> </u>

* The system lacks automation in it everything requires human presence to operate, from verifying the investor's pitch and approving it before being listed.
* As an innovator the chances of finding an investor are very low, as a results of just listing the pitch and hoping that someone will notice that pitch.
* Before the innovator's pitch is approved he/she has to pay certain amount of money to the site for listing that pitch 
* The investors don't get the chance to list what they expect from a particular project for them to fund it, which doesn't assists the innovators when making their pitch or projects.
* The system have no mechanism of verifying the investors are the people who they say they are, the registered person may only be interested in scamming people.

 <u> <b> Advantages of the system </b> </u>

* The system is also available in south Africa to carter for South African citizens, which makes it more accessible by almost anyone in the country. By being available in South Africa it also means that it uses the country's currency.
* With the system being available within the country boarders it makes the innovators of South Africa to be fortunate because already the investors from South Africa already understands how things run within the country.
* Also the South African innovators have a chance to meet international innovators to invest in their project.

<u> <b> Areas of improvement  </b> </u>

* Adds automation to the system so it can filter pitches it receives automatically without human input.
* Allow every innovator to apply for investment fairly through proper channels to the investors within the field.
* Remove the paying of fees to innovator at the beginning and take only the commission when they receive the funds.
* Allow investors to list they preference when it comes to projects they will fund.

### 3. <u> <b> SPARTAN </b> </u>

<u> What is Spartan & How it works </u> 

Spartan is  a South African based firm that focuses on small to medium entrepreneurs(SME). It seeks to help them financially for various cases such as growth finance, bridging finance and special asset finance. They usually fund within the bracket R0.5m to R15m but do make exceptions if and when required. They have an online platform where a client can apply.  The application is done in stages to verify if you meet what they need or want.

They first assess whether or not you qualify through a form, on which you fill in some drop down options. This helps them determine if you are the client they are looking for and also to see if  they can help your SME. After the "do I qualify" assessment, if you make it, they ask for specific documents like bank statement, asset listings and shareholders information. After confirming the documents are in your possession, you move on to the next stage where you do the actual application and upload some of the documents. Once the application is reviewed and accepted, they set up an interview with you in person or via skype. Once all the above steps have gone well and passed the compliance checks then the pay-out is made[6].

 <u> <b> Disadvantages of the system </b> </u>

* They only sponsor SME's specifically hence if one has an idea they will not exactly be able to assist and present their ideas out there. System is not open to anyone who would like to partake.
* They are business oriented hence other ideas that are not exactly business from the on start will not be considered.
 They focus mainly on a single domain and are not open to other sub domains in different fields.
* They are a loaning system rather than a platform to help innovators pitch ideas to investors.
* They do not help start ups nor businesses under a R5m year turnover cap

<u> <b> Advantages of the system </b> </u>

* It is based in South Africa and specifically tailored for South Africa hence they are much more likely to finance you as they are also on the ground; in comparison to foreign based systems.
* They respond quickly and efficiently and can do pay outs in a very short space of time. System is very efficient.(Backed with Test
* They offer various tailored financial funding services for specific portfolio hence if you fit in those they will be able to help you swiftly. They also offer financial advice to their clients.

<u> <b> Areas of improvement  </b> </u>

* Consider ideas from clients and promote those ideas as they are and not only expecting SME's to be involved on their platform. Supporting start-ups would cater for more people also. 
* Removing the bottom financial cap of R0.5m as some businesses do not need that much when starting or can only back the finance to a value under the bottom cap.
* Reducing the bracket of domains they do not finance as it limits some very good businesses(ideas, start ups or currently in practise)


## Problem Statement
The fourth industrial revolution has brought massive technological changes and currently in South Africa there still remains a big gap between potential investors and innovators. There is a lack of platform that links the innovators with investors that can fund their project ideas. 

## Proposed Solution
The solution is to create an application which will be a foundation for innovation and creating technology-driven opportunities for local innovators in South Africa while creating a value chain for local input . The application should make it easier for people in South Africa to pitch an idea to an investor. The innovators should incur little to no expenses in voicing out an idea. The system should help the innovators pitch ideas to the investors in a way that maximizes their best chances of getting funded. A review system will also be included to help the investors make decisions by scrapping off data that is not up to par. The system should give people relevant information about starting something in regards to the laws that govern the land. The ultimate goal being to help innovators' ideas realize full potential and also investors spend money on something lucrative.

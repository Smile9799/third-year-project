# REQUIREMENTS EXTRACTION
 
## <u> <b> FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS </u> </b>

### <u> <b>Allow user to Log In (Authentication) </u> </b>

This deals with users providing the registration details they registered with on the website i.e. email address, password and the system verifying if the users are already registered with the site. Provided user is registered it means that user will be granted authority to account privileges. This helps even in creating a social interactive forum for users to engage in (discussion forums) and share ideas while helping each other.

### <u> <b> Distinguish between investor, innovator or reviewer (Authorization levels) </u> </b>

Authorization is the rights and permissions granted to a user or application that enables access to a network or computing resource. Once a user has been properly identified and authenticated, authorization levels determine the extent of system rights that the user has access to.(Eric Knipp, Edgar Danielyan, 2002). System should be able to do this.

### <u> <b> Store data in a database (Storage) </u> </b>

The platform should be able to store user data like emails, passwords, usernames, contact details, addressing etc. All the information in the database should be organized and stored in database tables. The database should be large enough  so that the storage quota cannot be exceeded. The structure should be ease of use, easily indexed, searched or modified.

### <u> <b> Allow innovator to propose an idea </u> </b>

Once registered, user has ability to create, comment on and send ideas via the platform. Categories should be reviewer -defined to help organize ideas into logical subgroups that makes it user accessible. Ideas have to fall into their respective groups.  

### <u> <b> Follow Legal and Regulatory requirements </u> </b>

Website should follow certain rules and regulations to make sure that it is legally compliant and eliminate the risk of any legal issues. This involves copyright issues and avoiding plagiarism. Basic rules for making a website go live should be followed. The most important requirement of a website that deals with User data is the Privacy Policy. This will define how the site will handle and use visitor's data. This will be useful to establish a bit of trust within innovators. Obtaining necessary licenses for content is crucial. The site should provide and elaborate Terms and Conditions. It should inform users about use of cookies.
 
### <u> <b> Reviewer and investor decision making </u> </b>

When the innovator has submitted their applications and ideas , the reviewers should then review the applications .The reviewers are people who specializes in the area in which each idea is related to ,so they will decide if the idea is worth investing in. Once the idea has been approved by the reviewer, it is then sent to the investors related to that idea and will have to make their own decision whether they would want to invest in the idea. The platform should be able to convey the responses to the right person.  

### <u> <b> Automation to evaluate and prune ideas </u> </b>

When the innovator has submitted their documents ,details and qualifications , the system should be able to verify if the innovator has submitted all the required documents and verify their details. If the innovator does not comply , then the system should not register the user.  

### <u> <b> Meeting setup between Innovator and Investor </u> </b>

Once an idea has been approved and the investor is enthusiastic about the idea, a meeting should be scheduled for the two parties to meet and discuss deeply on the idea.

### <u> <b> Feedback provided to the Innovator </u> </b>

The system should provide feedback to the Innovator on the status of the proposed idea. 

### <u> <b> Provide the terms and conditions to the users </u> </b>

The system should clearly inform on all the terms and conditions so that they are all clearly understood and mot vaguely presented. This will help especially innovators who want to pitch their ideas.

## NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Setting directions for interviews

### Speed of reviewing applications
The platform should be capable of performing reviews with speed and efficiency so that the innovators can get feedbacks fast. This will also help the investors to receive applications quickly and also provide feedback to the innovators about their ideas. 

### The System should be scalable
The platform should be able to handle the increase in the number of people using the system at each and every time and the number and growth of resources to process at any given time. The platform should be able to adapt to any changes and still perform at full capacity. 

### The system should always be available.
When the system is enquired by the users , it should always be available and it should always give freedom to the users on the site. The site should also be available of online store platforms so that it can be easily downloaded by users. 

### The platform should have data integrity 
The platform should  able to provide the same consistency and accuracy in storing and retrieving data throughout the entire lifecycle of the system and it should be able to maintain this state.
### The system should be reliable
That  is ,it must perform its intended purpose and give response when a problem arises.The system should also be consistent so that users can depend on the system. The system should perform in such a way that users will develop a strong trust of the system

### The system should be responsive and give feedback as to what stage the innovator is on. 
When the user is using the system, it should  respond to the users request and inputs in the shortest amount of time. The system should also respond to any external factors that may affect the system and must be able to save and return to the previous state once the factors have been responded to.

### The system should be Secure
The users password and important information must not be stored in plain text to protect information. The system should be able to store ideas of innovators in a safe database so as to eliminate the chances of people's ideas to be stolen or being used by other users. The system should  follow the Protection of Peoples Information  Act and some rules and regulations for copy rights.

### Allow user to Register 

Registration is a very crucial process for most user websites. This in turn will give website users access to some of the  restricted content. In order for an innovator to be granted full access there has to be an account associated to the user. Once one has registers, they get the privileges to create a personalized profile giving reviewers and idea on who they will be dealing with. This is a fundamental step for the website as it is very helpful in collecting user demographics to improve the availability and accessibility of the site. It becomes easy to store data and keep track of users who are registered.

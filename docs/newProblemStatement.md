# <u>Problem Statement </u>

South Africa has one of the largest inequality ratios in the world.(1) The inequality means
a few have resources and the vast majority are poor. The economy is dwindling which
was coupled by the lockdowns and spread of the coronavirus. Economic resuscitation
entails economic investments but unfortunately, ​despite the fourth industrial revolution
bringing massive technological changes, there is a big gap between potential investors
and innovators. There is a lack of platforms that link the innovators with investors that
can fund their project ideas

# <u>Proposed Solution </u>

The solution is to create a platform in the form of an application which will be a foundation for
innovation and creating technology-driven opportunities for local innovators in South Africa while
creating a value chain for local input . The application should make it easier for people to pitch an
idea to an investor. The innovators should incur little to no expenses in voicing out an idea. The
system should help the innovators pitch ideas to the investors in a way that maximizes their best
chances of getting funded. A review system will also be included to help the investors make
decisions by removing faulty applications and refining the applications. The system should give
people relevant information about starting a business or project in regards to the laws that govern
the land. The ultimate goal being to help innovator's ideas realize full potential and also investors
spend money on promising ideas​. ​The solution is to create a platform in the form of an
application which will be a foundation for innovation. The application would raise awareness as to
how investment goes for those who have ideas and conscientize them on how to go about it.
The platform also would provide the investors with projects worthwhile to fund since there would
be a reviewal system.
